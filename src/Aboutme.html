                <h2>My Journey in software engineering</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a software engineering student at AAIT and I am passionate about technology. I joined A2SV, a program that connects me with top tech companies in the US. I learned web and machine learning skills from A2SV and I made some cool projects with them. For example, I made a todo list app that helps me plan my day and a weather app that shows me the weather in different places. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and nodejs to make these apps. I also used APIs to get data from OpenWeatherMap and Dark Sky. These projects show that I can work with web technologies and data. I am proud of what I have done and I want to keep learning and creating. I love my work because I think technology can make life easier and better for everyone.
